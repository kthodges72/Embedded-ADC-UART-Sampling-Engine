This is the repository for my STM32 personal project. 

This is a work in progress and I will flush out the README as I go along with the project. The currect state of this repo is immediately after 1. I arranged my file tree 2. I finished the 'usart' driver module 3. I wrote the skeleton of my circbuf module 4. I wrote some initialization code in main.c

I will add a general project outline soon...
